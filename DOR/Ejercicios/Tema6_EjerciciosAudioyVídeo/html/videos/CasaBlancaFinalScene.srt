00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,580
lying anyway thanks for helping me out

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,050
I suppose you know this isn't going to

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,490
be very pleasant for either of us

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,860
especially for you I'll have to arrest

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,900

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:30,990

00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,690
ask mr. Rick

24
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,240
in a wave Nashville I would advise you

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,829
not to interfere I was willing to shoot

26
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,030
captain Renault and I'm willing to shoot

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,210

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,429

major stars has been shot

31
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:19,780
round up the usual suspects

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,360
my Nexus what do you

33
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,140
well Rick you're not only a

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,970
sentimentalist but you become a patriot

35
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,950
maybe but it seemed like a good time to

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,700
start

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,870
I think perhaps our right

38
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,120
it might be a good idea for you to

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,030
disappear from Casablanca for a while

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,290
there's a free French garrison over a

41
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,180
browser view I could be induced to

42
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,850
arrange a passage my letter of transit I

43
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,670
could use a trip it hasn't made it if

44
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,350
it's about our bet she's still only ten

45
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,360
thousand francs and that ten thousand

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,760
francs should pay our expenses our

47
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,660
expenses Louie I think this is the

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,890
beginning of a beautiful friendship

49
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,730
you
