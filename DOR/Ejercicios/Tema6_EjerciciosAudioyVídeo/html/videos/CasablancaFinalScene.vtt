ask mr. Rick

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.829
in a wave Nashville I would advise you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.030
not to interfere I was willing to shoot

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.210

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.780
round up the usual suspects

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.360
my Nexus what do you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.970
well Rick you're not only a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.950
sentimentalist but you become a patriot

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.700
maybe but it seemed like a good time to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.870
start

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.870
I think perhaps our right

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.030
it might be a good idea for you to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.290
disappear from Casablanca for a while

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.180
there's a free French garrison over a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.850
browser view I could be induced to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.670
arrange a passage my letter of transit I

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.350
could use a trip it hasn't made it if

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.360
it's about our bet she's still only ten

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.760
thousand francs and that ten thousand

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.660
francs should pay our expenses our

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.890
expenses Louie I think this is the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.890
beginning of a beautiful friendship

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.730
you
