00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.586
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:07.054
You think of everything, don't you?

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:09.815
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:13.839
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:15.771
I don't understand.
What about you?

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:20.565
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:22.734
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:24.694
Last night we said a great many things.

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:26.779
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:29.616
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:32.452
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.454
Now, you've got to listen to me.

00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.498
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:40.960
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:43.421
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.008
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:49.469
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:51.971
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:55.016
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:58.728
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:01.689
But what about us?

00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:03.274
We'll always have Paris.

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:06.444
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.488
We got it back last night.

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:13.159
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.161
But I've got a job to do too.

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.871
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:19.123
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.251
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:24.879
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:27.757
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:30.468
Someday you'll understand that.

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:33.388
Now, now.

00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:37.350
Here's looking at you, kid.

00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:54.993
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.370
There's something you should know.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.372
I don't ask you to explain anything.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.667
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:04.711
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:07.714
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.342
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:13.011
Yes.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.221
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

00:02:15.388 --> 00:02:18.892
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:21.603
But that was all over long ago.

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.064
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:27.191
I understand.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.569
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:32.071
I appreciate it.

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.699
Welcome back to the fight.

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.410
This time I know our side will win.

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:53.301
Are you ready, Ilsa?

00:02:55.178 --> 00:02:56.554
Yes, I'm ready.

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.059
Goodbye, Rick.

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:03.811
God bless you.

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:07.857
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.835
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:30.838
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:32.340
What you just did for Laszlo.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.926
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.428
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

00:03:37.637 --> 00:03:39.639
But she knew you were lying.

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:41.766
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:45.228
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:46.563
Especially for you.

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.899
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.867
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:01.286
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.957
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:08.167
Ask Monsieur Rick.

00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:13.298
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:16.759
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.305
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

00:04:20.513 --> 00:04:22.348
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:38.948
Major Strasser has been shot.

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:46.372
Round up the usual suspects.

00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:12.232
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

00:05:12.398 --> 00:05:14.025
...but you've become a patriot.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.361
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:18.488
I think perhaps you're right.

00:05:43.263 --> 00:05:46.975
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:49.602
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:53.565
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:55.024
I could use a trip.

00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:58.486
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

00:05:58.778 --> 00:06:01.614
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:03.032
"Our" expenses?

00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:08.079
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
